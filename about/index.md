Kyle Moore is a recent graduate of Stanford University who currently does contract programming for whoever will pay him. He write MosquitOS, a modern toy operating system, in order to gain a better low-level understanding of the x86\_64 architecture and the hardware in modern computers. It will never be useful for anything except learning how computers work.

When he's not writing code, Kyle enjoys rock climbing, cycling, and getting altitude sickness.
